    In this hands-on review, I ran PromptPerfect through three real-world scenarios:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Testing brevity vs. completeness.</li>
    <li><strong>Creative rewriting:</strong> Comparing tone and style controls.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical prompts:</strong> Ensuring accuracy on domain-specific queries.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Bottom line: PromptPerfect consistently tightened up verbose inputs by 30–40%,
    eliminated ambiguity in multi-step instructions, and even preserved critical details
    when condensing text. Its real power lies in the live preview panel—so you can
    instantly compare “before” and “after” and tweak for tone, length, or formality.
