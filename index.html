<!--
You typically do not need any content here in index.html if your 
_layouts/home.html file defines all the sections (hero, tutorials, blog, etc.).
Jekyll will take this front matter, use _layouts/home.html, and the {{ content }}
tag in home.html (if it were to inherit from default.html and use {{ content }} there)
would be empty, which is fine if home.html builds the whole page.

If _layouts/home.html *itself* has a {{ content }} tag (perhaps because it inherits
from _layouts/default.html which has the main container for {{ content }}),
then any Markdown/HTML you put here would be injected into that {{ content }} spot
within the structure defined by _layouts/home.html.

For your setup, where _layouts/home.html seems to contain all the sections,
just the front matter above is likely sufficient.
