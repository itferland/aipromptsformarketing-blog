# About AI Solutions Consulting

Practical automation, built by someone who’s been on the front lines.

## Meet the Founder
I’m Eric Ferland—an infrastructure and security engineer who spent 15 years running lean IT environments where uptime mattered and budgets didn’t bend. After managing everything from municipal police-department networks to global travel-tech clouds, I kept seeing the same pattern:

Powerful tools fall flat when they ignore day-to-day workflows.

AI Solutions Consulting exists to bridge that gap—pairing real-world ops experience with lightweight, AI-driven automation so you get results this quarter, not next year.

## Mission
Help resource-strapped teams unlock speed, security, and scale by making advanced automation practical and painless.

## Core Values
- **Innovation, minus the hype** – Pilot fast, prove value, then scale.
- **Collaboration first** – We build with you, not for you.
- **Adaptability** – Solutions flex to your stack, budget, and talent.
- **Integrity** – Clear scopes, transparent pricing, brutal honesty.
- **Empowerment** – We up-skill your team so the wins keep coming after we leave.

## The Journey So Far
- Ran a single-person IT department for 16 years at the Town of Meredith—partnering with vendors, maintaining CJIS compliance, and delivering 99.9% uptime with limited resources.*
- Tackled everything from Fortinet firewall rollouts to Google Workspace migrations for a fully remote workforce of 200+ at Atlas Travel & Technology.*
- Pivoted during a 2024 layoff to master generative-AI workflows, open-sourcing production-grade n8n stacks and building a job-search copilot that shortened hiring cycles from weeks to days.*
- Founded AI Solutions Consulting LLC in July 2025 to give growing companies the same unfair advantage.*

## Credentials & Proof Points
- 10+ years designing and securing hybrid infrastructures (Fortinet ⬩ Okta ⬩ Google Workspace ⬩ Veeam ⬩ VMware).
- Deep automation toolkit: Python, PowerShell, Node.js, n8n, Docker, GitHub Actions.
- Previously held CJIS Security Certification—evidence of working in high-compliance environments.
