June is here, and with it comes a wave of Father’s Day sales from a range of retailers — including Sonos, which is discounting everything from the Arc Ultra soundbar to the excellent Era 100 smart speaker.
 The Sonos Ace deal particularly stands out, as the wireless headphones are available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos for an all-time low of $329 ($120 off) through Sunday, June 15th.
The Sonos Ace offer top-notch sound quality and solid noise cancellation, with an exceptionally natural-sounding transparency mode for when you want to let the outside world in.
 What separates the over-ears from other pairs of noise-canceling headphones, though, is their unique integration with the Sonos ecosystem.
 Although they don’t work over Wi-Fi, the company’s TV Audio Swap feature does let you easily transfer audio to the headphones from a Sonos soundbar like the Arc or either generation of the Sonos Beam, allowing for private TV listening at the press of a button.
 The private listening mode also supports spatial audio / head tracking and works with any device plugged into your TV, including gaming consoles.
Build-wise, the Sonos Ace are comfortable and stylish, with magnetic memory foam ear cups and stainless steel slider arms for a more secure fit.
 They also offer up to 30 hours of battery life and USB-C, making them a solid choice for all-day use, as well as multipoint Bluetooth support, allowing multitaskers to pair them with two devices simultaneously.
