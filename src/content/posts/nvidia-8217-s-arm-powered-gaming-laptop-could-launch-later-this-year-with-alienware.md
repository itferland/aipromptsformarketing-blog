Nvidia’s Arm-based PC chip could make its debut in Alienware’s laptops later this year or in early 2026, according to a report from the Taiwanese publication United Daily News.
 The chipmaking giant is reportedly working with MediaTek to develop an accelerated processing unit (APU) that combines an Arm-powered CPU with Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU architecture.
Nvidia is already popular in traditional gaming laptops using Intel or AMD chips, but an Arm CPU entry may well improve the Windows on Arm gaming situation.
 Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chips have to run games emulated using Microsoft’s Prism software, and game compatibility and performance is severely limited on Qualcomm’s GPUs right now.&nbsp;
We first heard rumors about Nvidia’s Arm-based chip in 2023, which could serve as yet another competitor to Intel’s chips and the Arm processors built by Qualcomm.
 Last week, a video from YouTuber Moore’s Law is Dead showed off what appears to be a leaked image of Nvidia’s rumored APU, with sources suggesting it could run between 80W and 120W.&nbsp;
In January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during an investor’s presentation that the company has “plans” for the Arm-based CPU installed inside Digits, its personal AI supercomputer, Reuters reported at the time.
 Dell CEO Michael Dell also hinted at the possibility of launching an AI PC with Nvidia, as he replied, “come back next year” when asked about Nvidia’s presence in the AI PC market during an interview in 2024.
Nvidia isn’t the only company that could challenge Qualcomm’s dominance in the Arm-based CPU space.
 MediaTek is also rumored to be working on an Arm chip of its own, while recent reports also suggest AMD is developing an Arm-based chip for Microsoft Surface laptops.
