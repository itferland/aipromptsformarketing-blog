The Pixel 10 phones are likely to look an awful lot like last year’s Pixel 9 models.
Google will reportedly launch the Pixel 10 series at a Made by Google event on August 13th, with the handsets arriving in stores a week later on the 20th.
Leaker @MysteryLupin was the first to tip the launch date, which Android Headlines echoed just minutes later, adding in the extra detail of when the phones will actually reach buyers.
 This year Google is expected to launch four Pixel 10 phones, with a regular model, Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold.
 It’s likely Google will announce the Pixel Watch 4 at the same event.
Plenty of details about the Pixel 10 series have leaked so far.
 The base model is expected to join the others in having three cameras, adding a telephoto to its lineup, but will make some camera quality tradeoffs to get there.
 The Pro models, including the Fold, are rumored to change less, with near-identical camera hardware and designs to last year, leaning instead on an upgraded Tensor G5 chipset with advanced AI features to motivate Pixel fans to upgrade.
As for the Pixel Watch 4, leaked renders suggest it’ll be thicker than the previous generation, which may mean a bigger battery.
 Google has apparently tweaked the watch’s charging tech, too, and added a couple of mysterious new buttons.
 It should also mark the debut of Google’s Gemini AI assistant on its smartwatches, while all the new Pixel devices will boast the company’s youthful new Material 3 Expressive design language on the software side.
Last year’s Pixel 9 series also launched on August 13th, though those phones took longer to go on sale, with the 9 Pro Fold not arriving for almost a month.
