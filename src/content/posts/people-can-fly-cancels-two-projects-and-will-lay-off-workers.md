People Can Fly has announced it has cancelled two in-development projects and will undergo a round of layoffs.&nbsp;
“Today we made the very difficult decision to suspend the development of project Gemini and project Bifrost,” wrote People Can Fly CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski on the studio’s LinkedIn page. “As a result we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams.” Little was known publicly about either project.
The Warsaw-based studio known for Bulletstorm and Outriders&nbsp; has been having difficulties with some of its in-development projects for a while now.
 In December, a notice from the company stated it would suspend production on a project codenamed Victoria and reduce the team working on Bifrost.
 In today’s announcement, Wojciechowski wrote that cancellations were due to an unspecified publisher’s failure to present necessary publishing agreements, and a “lack of communication” regarding whether or not the publisher wants to continue with development.&nbsp;
The statement also attributed the cancellations to issues with the publisher’s cash flow stating it, “showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue the production.” And the name of the publisher? It isn&#8217;t exactly a mystery.
 In the developer’s statement from December, People Can Fly named its collaborator on Project Gemini as Square Enix.People Can Fly — which was acquired by Epic Games in 2012 before going independent again in 2015 — will continue development on Xbox’s next Gears of War title, Gears of War: E-Day, as a partner studio working with The Coalition.
