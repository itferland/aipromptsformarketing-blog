Panasonic may not be as well-known in the US for its TVs as it is in other parts of the globe, but that’s starting to change.
 The company has a solid lineup of high-end TVs that are available through Amazon, one of which is selling at a great price right now.
 Its 65-inch Z85 OLED TV with Amazon’s Fire TV software built-in is $997.99, a whopping 45 percent off its original $1,799.99 price when it debuted in late 2024.
 That’s a good deal by itself, one that’s made better with a bundle that includes the aforementioned TV plus Panasonic’s wireless neck speaker for just $2 more (totaling $999.99).
The Z85 features HDMI 2.1 ports on two of its four HDMI ports (through which it can display 4K resolution at up to 120Hz), plus Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus support.
 It ships with other bells and whistles that most people are looking for in a premium television (especially gamers), like variable refresh rate (VRR), plus adaptive sync via AMD’s FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync.
 Not bad at all for under $1K.
I looked up this model on RTINGS, a resource that I use for technical breakdowns that put TVs advertised specs to the test.
 For the price, this TV fares pretty well, but not as well as most brands’ flagship models when it comes to brightness or handling glare.
Some other sweet deals to get your week started
Sometimes, you just need a capable, lil’ portable battery — nothing that won’t easily fit into a small bag.
 For that, it’s easier than usual to recommend Anker’s 10,000mAh 30W battery, as it’s $12.94 at Amazon (originally $25.99, but regularly discounted).
 Its small capacity isn’t suited for laptops, but phones or tablets that need a quick, zippy charge are a great fit.
 Best of all? It has a built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a handle.
If you enjoy movies and physical media, what better gadget to pair with your 4K TV than a 4K Blu-ray player? Panasonic is coming through, once again, with another good deal today.
 Its mid-range DP-UB420-K 4K Blu-ray player is selling for $217.99 at Amazon and $219.99 at Best Buy.
 Either price is among the lowest that we’ve seen for this media player in the past couple of months.
 This model supports HDR10 Plus, HDR10, and HLG formats, plus Wi-Fi support in case you need yet another device that can stream Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube.
 The big feature differentiating this model from the $398 DP-UB820-K is Dolby Vision HDR — the 420-K lacks it.
One of the best deals of Sony’s Days of Plays promotion is on the digital slim PS5, which starts at $399.99 and comes with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.
 But for $449.99 at Best Buy, you can get the slim PS5 model that includes a disc drive, along with the free game.
 We recommend that model if you want to play disc-based games, as well as 4K Blu-rays and DVDs.
 Normally, the disc drive separately costs $79.99, so you’re getting $30 off of that accessory on top of the $50 Days of Play discount on the console bundle through June 11th.
