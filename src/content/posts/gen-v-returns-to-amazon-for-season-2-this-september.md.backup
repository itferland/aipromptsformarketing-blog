While we&#8217;re still a ways out from The Boys returning to Amazon for its fifth season, the franchise&#8217;s spinoff series, Gen V, will be back this fall.
At this year&#8217;s CCXP convention in Mexico, Amazon announced that Gen V is set to return for its second season on September 17th with a three episode premiere.
 Along with the premiere date news, Amazon also released a new trailer teasing some of the challenges Marie (Jaz Sinclair), Emma (Lizze Broadway), Jordan (London Thor and Derek Luh), are going to be up against as they return for another year of studying at Godolkin University.
With the White House now effectively under Homelander&#8217;s control, Godolkin has become a very different, even more sinister place where a large chunk of the superpowered student body is coming around on the idea that regular humans are inferior beings.
 That&#8217;s the message Godolkin&#8217;s new dean, Cipher (Hamish Linklater) wants his students to take to heart as they learn to wield their powers by participating in what looks like a school-sanctioned fight club.
 But it&#8217;s hard for Marie and her friends to see Cipher as anything but an enemy given how the university locked them away for trying to stop Sam (Asa Germann) and Cate (Maddie Phillips) from murdering people without abilities.
Though Gen V&#8216;s younger character will be the primary focus this season, the trailer also makes clear that the new season will spend more time with Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas) as he investigates the death of his son Andre (Chance Perdromo, who died in a motorcycle accident last March ahead of the season&#8217;s production starting.) Suffice to say that things aren’t looking great for the Gen V kids, but as dire as the situation is about to get, it looks like they won’t be going down without a fight when we see them again this fall.
