    steps:
      # 1) Grab your code from the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Use version 3 of the checkout action

      # 2) Set up the specific Node.js environment needed
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3 # Use version 3 of the Node setup action
        with:
          node-version: '16' # Or replace '16' with the Node.js version your script requires

      # 3) Install the necessary Node.js packages
      # Assumes your script needs 'openai' (for Groq compatibility) and '@octokit/rest'
      # If you have a package.json, running 'npm ci' or 'npm install' might be better.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install openai @octokit/rest

      # 4) Run your Node.js script, passing the required API keys/tokens as environment variables
      - name: Run AI update script
        env:
          # ---- THIS IS THE UPDATED LINE ----
          # Pass the Groq API key stored in the GitHub Secret named GROQ_API_KEY2
          # The environment variable name the script uses (process.env.GROQ_API_KEY) is unchanged.
          GROQ_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GROQ_API_KEY2 }} # Use the NEW secret name here

          # Pass the GitHub token needed for Octokit to commit changes back to the repo
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
