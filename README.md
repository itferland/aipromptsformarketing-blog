Environment Variables
To run this project locally, create a `.env` file in the repository root with the following keys:

```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_client_side_key
GEMINI_API_KEY_SERVER=your_server_side_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
```

### Sitemap Generation

Run `npm run sitemap` to create `public/sitemap.xml` and update `public/robots.txt` with the sitemap URL. Submit this file to search engines to improve indexing.

The script scans `src/pages` for `.tsx` files and automatically updates the list of URLs. Run it again whenever you add or rename a page to keep the sitemap current.

### Installation

Before running the build or development server, install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can start a dev server using `npm run dev` or create a production build with `npm run build` (also used by Netlify, see [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml)).
